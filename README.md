# MS BANK

Hello, 
welcome in the repository for my sample project (Bank application) that was created for several reasons:

1. Example project for interview purposes
2. To explore and play with new technologies and approaches
3. To start a solo project from scratch (in the past most of the time I worked on projects that were already configured and all base logic was taken care of), this is an opportunuty for me to prepare this logic by myself.

## Technologies/approaches/ideas/features 
Bellow you can find quite an extensive list of features and ideas which I would like to try. Some of them are already prepared in the application, some of them are just ideas for a backlog.

* Kotlin
* MVVM
* Live data
* Data binding
* Material components
* Koin
* Navigation components with Safe Args
* Tests
* Lottie animations
* Custom mock rest API (https://beeceptor.com/)
* Rx and Corutines
* DiffUtil.ItemCallback for recycler adapters
* Multiple modules
* Detekt
* Dark mode
* Push notifications
* QR payments
* App shortcuts
* Widget
* Adaptive icon
* Coil
* Validation for cards and bank accounts
* Animations with Motion layout

## Disclaimer 
I am aware that some logic in the application would not be required in the real world because it would be designed differently and it would most likely be done on BE, but because my API is mocked this is not possible. On the other hand it gives me opportunity do it myself.
